# DSRWay
Responding to Analysis and Communication: DS the R Way

You have heard about [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and would like to learn and see what it does and how it works?

Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and you will get to know how to use its tools needed in a typical data science project. We will introduce you to graphical and numerical techniques for exploring the information concealed within a dataset. We will use [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package to carry out data manipulation with [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) in an intuitive to write and easy to read manner, especially when using the “chaining” syntax of [pipes](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/). Through the use of [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) we will learn how to create graphs to visualise distributions, relationships and model fits. After we develop an understanding of our data we will use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)’s interactive approach in telling our data story by creating reproducible [R-Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) Web Apps. 

This is a suitable workshop for people who have no previous experience in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and are interested in learning to use it for their data analysis.
